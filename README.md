# Freshnel-Shader
### **Step 1**
Download the project, and open in Unity.
### **Step 2**
Click play, and you will see the shader with recomended settings. These settings will be discussed further down.
### **Step 3**
To change settings, click on the "fresnel mat" material in the assets folder. In the inspector there will be three settings to change from, namely: Fresnel Strength, Fresnel Ramp and Animation speed.

## What the settings does

**Fresnel Strength**
Recomended setting = 0.5
This setting changes the strength of the fresnel shader. Any value above 0.5 will cause it to overload, which results in a purple color on otherwise transparent areas.

**Fresnel Ramp**
Recomended setting = 1
The ramp defines how much of the object will be effected by the fresnel effect.

**Animation Speed**
Recomended setting = 75
Changes the speed of the animation, 0 will stop the animation entirely
